# Web Dev (LS 2020) Week 2: CSS

Welcome back to Week 2 of our course on Web Development.
This week we will proceed further on our journey to becoming Web Developers, with focus on learning the core aspects and features of CSS. Our aim will be to help you master adding layout and a bit of style to your webpage, utilizing the power of CSS.

We expect you to have gone through the articles for [Git](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/Git.md) and [HTML](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/HTML.md), as we will be building up on it, adding to your Web Development skills.

So let's get on with it!


## Getting Started

Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing how the content, written in some markup language should be displayed on screen. It controls the style and layout of web pages. So one can use CSS to alter the text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of webpages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML. A working knowledge of HTML combined with a mastery over CSS will help you to design a fine look and feel to a webpage.

No further setup or installation is required for adding CSS attributes to an HTML page. As you already have a working webpage, you will only need the text/code editor you have set up last week.

Check out this [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) for understanding what CSS is, its basic structure and how it ties in with HTML.
