# Web Dev (LS 2020) Week 3: BOOTSTRAP+ JAVASCRIPT

Welcome back to Week 3 of our course on Web Development.
This week we will proceed further on our journey to becoming Web Developers, with focus on learning the core aspects and features of BootStrap and JavaScript.

We expect you to have gone through the articles for [Git](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/Git.md) ,[HTML](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/HTML.md) and [CSS](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%202/CSS.md), as we will be building up on it, adding to your Web Development skills.

Note: Bootstrap is Optional and you might skip it as well.

So let's get on with it!

## What is Bootstrap? 
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for creating common user interface components like forms, buttons, navigations, dropdowns, alerts, modals, tabs, accordions, carousels, tooltips, and so on.
Bootstrap gives you ability to create flexible and responsive web layouts with much less efforts.

## Getting Started with JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
