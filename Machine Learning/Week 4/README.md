# Week 4

Welcome to Week 4! This week you are going to develop your understanding about neural networks and deep learning. 

Last week you studied about various machine learning algorithms.It’s a pertinent question. There is no shortage of machine learning algorithms so why should we gravitate towards deep learning algorithms? What do neural networks offer that traditional machine learning algorithms don’t?
### Why are neural nets preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms ?
Well, here are two key reasons why researchers and experts tend to prefer Deep Learning over Machine Learning:
- **Decision Boundary:** In the case of classification problems, the algorithm learns the function that separates 2 classes, this is known as a Decision boundary. Every Machine Learning algorithm is not capable of learning all the functions. This limits the problems these algorithms can solve that involve a complex relationship.

-**Feature Engineering:**
