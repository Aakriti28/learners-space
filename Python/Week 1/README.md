## Welcome to Week 1 of Learner Space's Python! 
For the first week we will be covering some basic topics:
* Installation and Setup 
* Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
* Introduction to Data Types and Data Structures in Python
* Operators in Python 
* Conditions and Loops 
* Assignment for Week 1

We will be taking a very elementary approach for this course so that even a complete beginner can learn to code in Python. Python is the most diverse language with very varied applications in different fields such as Research, Machine Learning, Backend Web Development, Data Visualisation, Web Scraping and much more, and this is possible only because of the different libraries and frameworks available for Python. We will be covering some of the libraries in the later part of the course, so Stay Tuned! 

Let's get started! 


### Installation and Setup 
Visit [this](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) link for a detailed guide on installing and setting up Python. 

### Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter notebook is a web based notebook environment which is widely used for interactive programming, that is, code execution combined with rich markdown text and much more. The Jupyter notebook runs a local Ipython kernel on your machine and launches in your web browser. These notebooks are also called as Ipython notebooks, and have a '.ipynb' extension instead of traditional '.py' extension for Python files. 
All the assignments for this course are made in Jupyter notebooks and you are expected to complete them in the notebook itself. Hence, it is important for you to get aquainted with Jupyter notebooks. 

Visit [this](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) link for installing and setting up a basic notebook. The link also teaches you to write and execute a basic Python code in a Notebook cell.
